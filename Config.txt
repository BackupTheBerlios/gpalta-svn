#------------ General behavior ------------
# Use vectorial evaluation
# On this mode, the system descends on the tree once and evaluates all fitness
# cases on a loop. On the contrary, when using normal evaluation, the system
# descends on the tree for each fitness case.
# The number of operations is the same, but vectorial evaluation should be
# faster when using lots of fitness cases.
# Note that with vectorial evaluation, all nodes on the tree are always
# evaluated. Instead, when using normal evaluation, sometimes the second kid
# doesn't need to be evaluated because the result can be determined using
# only the first kid (e.g on an "And" node if the first kid evals to zero)
# This could eventually lead to a slowdown instead of speeding things up,
# or cause problems when nodes have side effects (perform actions)
